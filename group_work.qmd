## 1 Background 

### 1.1 From Strict Control to Deregulation

Historically, London government restricted short-term lets in response to the shortage of affordable housing in the capital since 1973 [@ferreri_platform_2018]. This changed decisively with the introduction of the Deregulation Act 2015. To encourage the growth of the sharing economy, the 90-day rule was introduced, which allows residents to rent out their spare rooms or entire houses on a short-term basis lawfully without planning permission. The government believed that it would enable Londoners to participate in the sharing economy and get financial benefits, boosting London's economy in turn.

### 1.2 The Rise of Professional Landlords

Airbnb, as a typical representative of the sharing economy, has successfully expanded from 14,000 listings in June 2015 to around 49,000 listings in October 2016 following this policy shift. However, as the scales increased rapidly, Airbnb gradually deviated from its original purpose, from the idea of casual home-sharing to commercial operations. The emergence of a growing number of professional landlords who utilize entire properties as full-time hotels is exerting a significant negative influence on the stability of the London housing market [@gyodi_spatial_2024]. 

### 1.3 Current Challenges

There is a conflict between the commercialization of home-sharing and the original housing goals. Therefore, the opposition argued that Airbnb in London is "out of control" and proposed to force all professional landlords to register their properties and receive higher Council Tax rates. To inform future decisions, this report analyzes the current state of London Airbnb market and evaluates the likely impacts of the opposition's proposal. It also explores how we can turn this challenge into a positive narrative to strengthen public trust.

## 2 Data Pre-processing

**Data sources**

This analysis is based on data from **Inside Airbnb**, a widely used open dataset derived from publicly available information on the Airbnb platform. Although the data are not produced by an official government body, they are extensively used in academic research and policy analysis to examine the impacts of short-term rentals in cities, including London. The dataset is maintained by the Inside Airbnb Network, a mission-driven initiative that seeks to facilitate transparent public discussion about short-term rentals and their effects on local communities. Its open methodology and consistent use across peer-reviewed studies support its credibility as a data source.

**Scope and coverage of the dataset**

We use the London listings dataset scraped in 2025, which originally contains 96,871 listings across 79 variables, represented as geocoded point data with detailed attribute information. From this, we selected 26 variables relevant to policy concerns, covering property characteristics, host activity, availability patterns, and review activity. This ensured the analysis focused on indicators most relevant to housing pressure and professional short-term letting.

**Data cleaning and preparation**

Several data cleaning steps were undertaken to improve reliability. Listings with missing values in critical fields (such as price) were removed. Key variables were standardised, including converting prices from text to numeric format. We excluded implausible or inactive listings, such as those with minimum stay requirements exceeding 365 days, which likely indicate non-operational or “ghost” listings. Extremely high review rates (over 31 reviews per month) were also removed, as these are inconsistent with residential letting and likely reflect hotels or data artefacts. Similarly, extreme price outliers (above $3,000 per night) were excluded to remove clear errors while retaining high-end but plausible listings.

**Treatment of professional hosts**

Notably, we did not exclude hosts with very large portfolios (e.g. host listings counts exceeding 1,000). While extreme, these values likely represent large property management companies and are central to assessing claims that Airbnb activity in London has become increasingly commercialised.

**Final analytical dataset and reliability**

After cleaning, the final analytical dataset contains 47,971 listings across 26 variables. While some uncertainty remains—particularly due to the absence of official administrative records—the resulting dataset provides a robust and policy-relevant representation of Airbnb activity in London, suitable for assessing scale, spatial concentration, and the role of professional hosts.

```

```{python}
#| echo: False
#Loading London housing data

```

```{python}

    ]
    .iloc[0]              
    .replace(",", "")    
)

london_total_house = int(london_total_house)
london_total_house

airbnb_share = n_airbnb / london_total_house * 100
```

```{python}
#| output: asis
print(f"As of the 2025 scrape, London hosts {n_airbnb} active Airbnb listings. When compared with the city’s total housing stock, this represents approximately {airbnb_share:.2f}% of all dwellings.

### 3.2 The Spatial Distribution of Airbnb Listings

```{python}
#| echo: False
#Loading London boundary data
url_boro = "https://github.com/mixedmint/fsds_group/releases/download/data_boro/London_Borough_Excluding.gpkg"
boros = gpd.read_file(url_boro).to_crs(27700)
```

```{python}
#| echo: False

    """
    x0, x1 = ax.get_xlim()
    y0, y1 = ax.get_ylim()

    sb_x = x0 + (x1 - x0) * location[0]
    sb_y = y0 + (y1 - y0) * location[1]

    # number of segments (use 2 or 4 typically)
    segments = 4
    segment_length = length / segments

    for i in range(segments):
        ax.add_patch(plt.Rectangle(
            (sb_x + i * segment_length, sb_y),
            segment_length,
            bar_height,
            facecolor='black' if i % 2 == 0 else 'white',

    f"{int(length/1000)} km",
    fontsize=10,
    ha="center",                
    va="bottom"                  
)
```

```{python}
#| echo: False
#Mapping
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10,10))
gdf_airbnb.plot(ax=ax, markersize=1, alpha=0.5,label="Airbnb Listings")  
boros.plot(ax=ax, edgecolor='xkcd:lightblue',facecolor='none',linewidth=0.5) 
# Set the x and y limits
ax.set_xlim(501000, 563000)
ax.set_ylim(155000, 202000)

ax.set_title("Spatial Distribution of Airbnb Listings in London")

ax.legend(loc="lower right")
add_scalebar(ax, length=10000) 
```

The scatter map reveals the distinct **core-periphery pattern** of Airbnb listings in London. Listings are unevenly distributed, **forming a high-density cluster in inner London**, particularly along the River Thames, which is the core tourist and commercial area. By contrast, the distribution in outer London appears much sparser. This pattern suggests that **the short-term rental market is primarily driven by tourism demand**, creating disproportionate pressure on housing stock in the city center.

Next, we analyzed the spatial density distribution of Airbnb listings across all boroughs.

```{python}
#| echo: False
#Spatial join the airbnb and boroughs data
joined = gpd.sjoin(gdf_airbnb, boros, how="left", predicate="within")

#get the sum of Airbnb listings in every borough
airbnb_by_boros = joined.groupby("NAME")[["geometry"]].count().reset_index()
airbnb_by_boros.columns = ["NAME", "n_listings"]

boros = boros.merge(airbnb_by_boros, on="NAME", how="left")
boros["n_listings"] = boros["n_listings"].fillna(0)
```

```{python}
#| echo: False
#calculating the area
boros["area_km2"] = boros.geometry.area / 1e6
#calculating the density
boros["density"] = boros["n_listings"] / boros["area_km2"]
```

```{python}
#| echo: False
#maping
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10,10))

boros.plot(column="density",
            cmap="OrRd",
            linewidth=0.7,
            edgecolor="grey",
            legend=True,
            scheme="natural_breaks",
            ax=ax)

ax.set_title("Airbnb Listings Density by Local Authority (Borough) in London", fontsize=14)

add_scalebar(ax, length=10000)

plt.show()
```

As shown in the map, the Airbnb market is not evenly distributed. The highest density of listings is found in **Kensington and Chelsea** and **Westminster**, where the density is significantly higher than in other boroughs. A second tier of high density covers **Hammersmith and Fulham, Camden, Islington, Hackney and Tower Hamlets**-all located north of the River Thames. These boroughs represent London's core tourism and commercial hubs. The high densities reflect strong visitor demand but also highlight where the conflict between residential housing needs and short-term tourism accommodation is likely most acute.

## 4 Is Airbnb in London out of control?

### 4.1 How to define "out of control"
Defining an "out of control" Airbnb market is challenging as it is a qualitative description rather than a quantitative metric. There are no universal benchmarks-such as a specific price threshold or listing count-that can definitively describe a city's housing market status.

To solve this problem, we introduced **"Airbnb Misuse"** as a quantifiable proxy, drawing on the framework by @shabrina_airbnb_2022. We defined the Airbnb misuse as **"entire property listings available for more than 180 days accumulatively in one year (assuming the occupancy rate is 50%), hosted by landlords with 2 or more listings"**. Unlike the abstract macro-concept, "misuse" shifts the focus to the micro-level, assessing whether an individual listing is operating in compliance with local regulations, especially the 90-day rule, which makes it much easier to implement.

### 4.2 How many properties are misused?
First, we determined the listings count of each host. To ensure accuracy following our data cleaning process, we recalculated the listing count for each unique `host_id` rather than relying on the pre-exsiting `host_listings_count` column.

```{python}
#| echo: False
misuses_n_listings = (
    joined.groupby(['host_id', 'host_name'])
      .size()
      .reset_index(name='n_listings')
      .sort_values(by='n_listings', ascending=False)
)
joined = joined.merge(misuses_n_listings[['host_id', 'n_listings']], 
                      on="host_id", 
                      how="left"
)
```

Then we filtered the misuse listings in London based on our operational definition:

1. `room_type` = Entire house/apt

2. `availability_365` > 180

3. `n_listings` >= 2

```{python}
#| echo: False
#| output: asis
# Definition: Entire home + Availability > 180 + Host Listings >= 2

# Filtering out Misused houses for preparing next calculations
df_misuses = joined[
    (joined['room_type'] == 'Entire home/apt') &        
    (joined['availability_365'] > 180) &                
    (joined['n_listings'] >= 2)     
].copy()

n_misuses = len(df_misuses)
share_misuses = (n_misuses / len(joined)) * 100

print(f"Number of houses that meet the definition of misused propertise: {len(df_misuses)}\n")
print(f"Proportion of total housing: {share_misuses:.2f}%")
```

Our analysis shows that **25.86%** of Airbnb listings in London are classified as misuse, which represents a significant portion of the market. The next step is to examine the spatial distribution of these properties to understand their impacts on the housing market.

### 4.3 The distribution patterns of misused properties

Similar to the general distribution of the Airbnb listings, the misuse listings in London also reveal a distinct **core-periphery pattern**. They are highly concentrated in inner London, particularly along the River Thames, while activity in outer London remains relatively sparse.

We identified a cluster of intense commercialization in City of London, Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea and Camden. In these boroughs, the density of misuse listings is much higher than the city average, effectively turning residential zones into unregulated hotel districts. Furthermore, a significant spillover effect is observed in Hackney. As noted by @shabrina_airbnb_2022, attention should be paid to the high concentration in middle-income areas like Hackney, as it might correlate with the surge in housing prices.

### 4.4 The influence of Airbnb misuses
To evaluate pressures that the misused listings place on London housing stock, we introduced the concept of **Housing Loss Rate** (calculated as the number of misuse listings per 1000 dwellings per borough), which quantifying the properties of residential stock that have been diverted from long-term housing to short-term misused rentals. It serves as a critical indicator of housing displacement and housing squeeze experienced by local communities.

```{python}
#| echo: False
# definition: Focusing on analyzing the social impact of misused housing on housing stock (the number of misuses from chapter 4.2)
# Housing loss rate = the number of Airbnb misused houses in this area \ the total housing stock in this area (Census 2021) * 1000   
# Counting the number of misused houses in each administrative region
misuse_by_boros = df_misuses['NAME'].value_counts().reset_index()
misuse_by_boros.columns = ['NAME', 'Misuse_Count']
# Counting the number of houses in each administrative district from chapter 3.2
airbnb_by_boros = joined.groupby("NAME")[["geometry"]].count().reset_index()

The calculated housing loss rate reveals disparities in how Airbnb misuse affects different boroughs. City of London stands out with a rate of **61.76%**, indicating a severe displacement of residential stock. It is followed by a high-pressure tier: Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea, and Camden, all with rates **exceeding 30%**. A drop in intensity is observed after Camden, suggesting the pressure on housing stock begins to ease in other boroughs.

Based on the data, rather than focusing on the entire London, **we selected the top 4 boroughs-City of London, Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea, and Camden-as priority "target boroughs"**, since they represent the core of commercial misuse. Additionally, we also include **Hackney** as a "target borough". While falling outside the top 10 in housing loss rate, it remains a critical borough where Airbnb misuse density strongly correlates with aggressive gentrification and rental price surge [@shabrina_airbnb_2022].

## 5 How many professional landlords are there?

### 5.1 How to define professional landlords
Consistent with our definition of "misuse" and aligning with the methodology of @shabrina_airbnb_2022, we define the Professional Landlords as **hosts possessing 2 or more listings**.

### 5.2 How many professional landlords in London

```{python}
#| echo: False
#| output: asis
# Definition: the house owned by the landlord > = 2 whole houses (Entire home) and rented for > 90 days every year
# Assumption: Due to the lack of direct 'rental days' data, we assume that:
# Annual rental days ≈ number_of_reviews_ltm(comments in the past 12 months)*minimum_nights （from Google Gemini)
# It's a conservative estimate, because not every guest leaves a comment.

# Step 1: Calculate the number of 'full rent' houses owned by each landlord
host_entire_counts = joined[joined['room_type'] == 'Entire home/apt'].groupby('host_id').size()
# Screening out the landlord ID with > = 2 sets of whole rental housing
potential_pro_ids = host_entire_counts[host_entire_counts >= 2].index

# Step 2: screen out active landlords (lease for more than 90 days)
# Focus only on the houses under the names of potential professional landlords
df_potential_pros = joined[joined['host_id'].isin(potential_pro_ids)].copy()

# Calculating the estimated rental days(Estimated Occupancy)
# Estimation proxy: Number of comments in the past 12 months * Minimum stay days. To prevent abnormal 
# values (such as minimum stay of 30 days x10 comments =300 days), you can set an upper limit or leave it as it is
# Using simple product as proxy index
df_potential_pros['est_occupancy'] = df_potential_pros['number_of_reviews_ltm'] * df_potential_pros['minimum_nights']

# Aggregate to the landlord level: if all the houses of a landlord add up to rent for more than 90 days? Or a single set?
# The definition of the problem is ‘a landlord who rents on Airbnb for more than 90 days a year’
# As long as there is any set of houses under the landlord's name (or accumulated) to meet the high-frequency rental, 
# it can be regarded as commercial operation.
# Assumption: If the estimated occupancy of  any set of  whole rental houses under the landlord's name is more than 90 days, 
# or all the whole rental houses have accumulated more than 90 days
# A stricter business definition usually refers to "total output". We calculate the total active days of all the rented houses under the landlord's name
pro_activity = df_potential_pros[df_potential_pros['room_type'] == 'Entire home/apt'].groupby('host_id')['est_occupancy'].sum()

# Determining professional landlord ID list
pro_landlord_ids = pro_activity[pro_activity > 90].index
n_pro_landlords = len(pro_landlord_ids)
total_hosts = joined['host_id'].nunique()

print(f"Number of people identified as 'professional landlords': {len(pro_landlord_ids)}\n")
print(f"The total number of landlords: {total_hosts:,}\n")
print(f"The proportion of professional landlords: {(n_pro_landlords / total_hosts) * 100:.2f}%")
```

Our analysis identified **1174** professional landlords in London. This group represents merely **4.78%** of the total host population. This confirms that the vast majority of Airbnb hosts in London remain casual home-sharers, aligning with the platform's original purpose.

This finding proves that 
the opposition's proposal, if adopted, would not affect the **95%** of ordinary hosts who participate in the sharing economy. The target group is small, distinct and manageable, ensuring the policy is administratively viable.

## 6 How many properties would be affected by the opposition’s proposal?
Based on our descriptive statistic and spatial distribution analysis, we conclude that **the Airbnb market in London is partially out of control**. This localized instability threatens both the housing market and social mobility.

To address that, **we support the core mechanism of the opposition's proposal: mandating the professional landlords register their properties and pay higher Council Tax rates**. However, rather than a blanket implementation on Airbnb across London, which would be administratively burdensome and unnecessary in low-density boroughs, we suggest a targeted approach **focusing on the "target boroughs": City of London, Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea, Camden and Hackney.**

### 6.1 What kind of properties would be affected?
Based on our targeted strategy, the policy would target properties that are:

1. **Classified as misused**
2. **Located within the "target boroughs"**

### 6.2 How many properties would be affected in London

```{python}
#| echo: False
#| output: asis
# 1. Five areas that are most affected
target_boros = [
    'City of London', 
    'Westminster', 
    'Kensington and Chelsea', 
    'Camden', 
    'Hackney'
]
target_properties = df_potential_pros[df_potential_pros['NAME'].isin(target_boros)]

# 2. Calculating the total number of affected properties and the number in each region
total_target_affected = len(target_properties)
target_n = target_properties['NAME'].value_counts().reset_index()
target_n.columns = ['Borough', 'Count']
total_london_pros = len(df_potential_pros)
target_n_total = target_n['Count'].sum()
concentration_ratio = (target_n_total / total_london_pros) * 100

print(f"Total number of properties affected by the opposition proposal in the target area: {total_target_affected}")
print(f"\nThese five districts have concentrated {concentration_ratio:.1f}% of the professional landlord houses in London.\n")

Based on our targeted strategy, **10,145** properties would be affected. Crucially, these five boroughs alone account for **47.8%** of all misuse properties in London. This concentration confirms the rationality of our targeted approach: **we can address the bulk of the "out of control" phenomenon by concentrating resources on just five boroughs**, maximizing impact while minimizing administrative costs.

## 7 What are the likely pros and cons of the opposition’s proposal? 
If the Mayor were to accept the opposition’s proposal to require professional landlords to register their Airbnb properties and face higher Council Tax rates, the policy would bring both opportunities and risks. Its impacts differ for the Mayor, residents, and the city as a whole.

### 7.1 For the Mayor
For the Mayor, **the proposal presents a strong opportunity to demonstrate targeted and evidence-based leadership**. By focusing on City of London, Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea, Camden, and Hackney, the policy directly addresses areas where Airbnb misuse is most concentrated. These five boroughs alone account for nearly half (47.8%) of all misused listings in London, despite representing only a small share of the city’s total area. Acting in these locations allows the Mayor to tackle the core of the problem rather than imposing citywide restrictions that may appear excessive.

Politically, the proposal is also defensible because it affects a narrow and clearly defined group. Our analysis shows that only around 4.8% of hosts qualify as professional landlords, meaning the policy would leave more than 95% of hosts unaffected. **This strengthens the Mayor’s ability to frame the intervention as proportionate and fair**.

However, risks remain. The targeted boroughs are highly visible, tourist-intensive areas, and policy changes there are more likely to attract media scrutiny. **Critics may still portray the proposal as harmful to entrepreneurship or tourism, particularly if its purpose is not communicated clearly**. The Mayor would therefore face reputational risks if enforcement appears inconsistent or if messaging fails to emphasise the limited scope of the policy.

### 7.2 For the Residents
For residents, especially in the 5 targeted boroughs, the benefits are substantial. These areas experience the highest levels of housing loss linked to Airbnb misuse, with City of London showing particularly severe displacement of residential stock. By discouraging professional short-term letting, the policy can help **return a meaningful number of properties to the long-term housing market, easing pressure on rents and improving residential stability**.

Residents may also benefit from **reduced neighbourhood disruption**. Lower concentrations of short-term visitors can enhance safety, reduce nuisance, and strengthen community cohesion in areas that currently experience high turnover.

However, there is a risk of **administrative spillover affecting genuine home-sharers**. Even if the policy targets professional landlords, casual hosts (e.g., those renting a spare room) might face confusion or increased bureaucracy if the verification process is complex. They may fear inadvertently breaching rules, leading to the result that responsible citizens stop hosting due to uncertainty. Therefore, clear communication and a simplified exemption process for single-listing hosts are vital to prevent backlash.

### 7.3 For the City
At the city level, the key advantage lies in **stabilising housing markets without undermining London’s overall tourism economy**. By concentrating on boroughs where misuse is most intense, the policy avoids unnecessary intervention in low-pressure areas. 

Conversely, a reduction in Airbnb supply may **temporarily affect the tourism market** by raising accommodation prices. However, this may redirect demand toward regulated hotels, which contribute more reliably to tax revenues or encourage visitors to stay in outer areas, supporting broader urban goals. With careful implementation, the policy can balance a vibrant visitor economy while prioritising housing for Londoners.

## 8 Can the story be reframed as a positive one about social mobility or housing opportunity?
While our analysis shows that parts of London’s Airbnb market are partially out of control, this does not mean that Airbnb as a whole is inherently harmful. When properly regulated, the platform can still support housing opportunity and social mobility, particularly for ordinary households.

### 8.1 Housing Opportunity
Our data show that around 95% of Airbnb hosts in London are not professional landlords, but casual home-sharers. This aligns closely with Airbnb’s original “sharing economy” model, in which underused housing space is temporarily made available rather than permanently removed from the residential market. In this sense, Airbnb can **improve the efficiency of housing use** by allowing spare rooms or temporarily vacant homes to be utilised.

From the demand side, short-term rentals also **expand accommodation options for visitors** who might otherwise be priced out of traditional hotels. This can be particularly important for lower-budget travellers, students, or people visiting family, supporting London’s role as an open and accessible global city. When limited to genuine home-sharing, Airbnb can therefore complement, rather than undermine, the wider housing system.

Crucially, our findings suggest that housing harm is not evenly distributed across the city. It is driven by a relatively small number of misused entire-home listings, concentrated in a few central boroughs. **This means the positive housing functions of Airbnb can be preserved while addressing its most damaging forms through targeted regulation**.

### 8.2 Social Mobility
From a social mobility perspective, Airbnb can **provide flexible income opportunities for ordinary residents**. Hosting allows homeowners to earn additional income by sharing space they already have, often with minimal upfront costs. For many middle- or lower-income households, this income can help cover mortgages, rent, or rising living expenses.

The low barriers to entry mean that participation is not limited to wealthy investors, but is accessible to people from diverse backgrounds. Airbnb itself reports that in 2023, hosts in the United States earned **$22 billion** in supplemental income, much of which was used to meet essential household costs [@airbnbnewsroom_hosts_2023]. While this figure is not directly transferable to London, it illustrates the broader potential of home-sharing to support household resilience.
